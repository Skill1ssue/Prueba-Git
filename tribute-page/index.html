          <p class="text-normal"><strong>Sanford Koufax</strong> (/ˈkoʊfæks/; né <strong>Braun</strong>; born December 30, 1935), nicknamed <strong>"the Left Arm of God"</strong>, is an American former baseball pitcher who played 12 seasons in Major League Baseball for the Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers from 1955 to 1966. Widely regarded as one of the greatest pitchers in baseball history, as well as the first major sports star on the West Coast, Koufax was the first three-time winner of the Cy Young Award, each time winning unanimously and the only pitcher to do so when a single award was given for both the leagues; he was also named the National League Most Valuable Player in 1963. Retiring at the age of 30 due to chronic pain in his pitching elbow, Koufax was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility in 1972 at the age of 36, the youngest player ever elected.</p>
          <div id="early-life">
            <h2 class="sub-title">Early life</h2>
            <p class="text-normal">Sandy Koufax was born in Brooklyn, New York, and grew up in the Bensonhurst neighborhood. His parents divorced when he was very young, and his mother, Evelyn, remarried Irving Koufax, who adopted Sandy and gave him his last name.</p>
            <p class="text-normal">In his youth, Koufax was more distinguished in basketball than in baseball. He attended Lafayette High School, where he was a talented basketball player. After high school, he attended the University of Cincinnati on a basketball scholarship. However, his baseball talent also caught attention, and during a summer with an amateur team, his pitching ability became evident.</p>
            <p class="text-normal">Koufax was discovered by the Brooklyn Dodgers and signed with the team in 1954. Despite his lack of formal training and experience in baseball, his exceptional speed and power as a pitcher were notable, leading the Dodgers to take a chance on his potential.</p>

          <div id="professional-career">
            <h2 class="sub-title">Professional Career</h2>
            <p class="text-normal">Sandy Koufax began his career with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1955. Despite showing flashes of his talent, his early years were marked by inconsistency and control issues. During this period, Koufax struggled to establish himself as a dominant pitcher.</p>
            <h3>Development and Dominance (1961-1966):</h3>
            <p class="text-normal">Koufax’s career truly took off in 1961 when the Dodgers moved to Los Angeles. Under the guidance of pitching coach Johnny Podres, Koufax improved his control and developed one of the most feared curveballs in baseball.</p>
            <p class="text-normal">From 1962 to 1966, Koufax became the most dominant pitcher in Major League Baseball. During this period, he led the league in earned run average (ERA) five times, won three Cy Young Awards (1963, 1965, 1966), and was selected to six All-Star Games.</p>
            <p class="text-normal">In 1963, Koufax won the pitching Triple Crown, leading the league in wins, strikeouts, and ERA. He repeated this feat in 1965 and 1966.</p>
            <p class="text-normal">Koufax pitched four no-hitters, including a perfect game on September 9, 1965, against the Chicago Cubs.</p>
            <h3>Postseason Success:</h3>
            <p class="text-normal">Koufax was instrumental for the Dodgers in the postseason. He helped the team win the World Series in 1959, 1963, and 1965. In the 1965 World Series, Koufax was named the MVP after pitching two complete-game shutouts in Games 5 and 7, leading the Dodgers to victory over the Minnesota Twins.</p>
          </div>
          <div id="retirement">
            <h2 class="sub-title">Retirement</h2>
            <p class="text-normal">Despite his success, Koufax suffered from chronic arthritis in his left elbow. At the age of 30, after the 1966 season in which he won 27 games, posted a 1.73 ERA, and struck out 317 batters, Koufax decided to retire to avoid permanent damage to his arm.</p>
            <h3>Achievements and Legacy:</h3>
            <p class="text-normal">Sandy Koufax was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1972, becoming the youngest player to receive this honor at the age of 36.</p>
            <p class="text-normal">He is widely regarded as one of the greatest pitchers in baseball history, known for his dominance, work ethic, and ability to perform under pressure.</p>
            <p class="text-normal">Koufax left an indelible mark on baseball, and his career is remembered as one of the most impressive and brief in the sport’s history.</p>
